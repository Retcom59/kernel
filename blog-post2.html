                                <h2 class="post-title">4 Processes Requiring Automation To Enable Fully Autonomous Drone Delivery In Urban Areas</h2>
                                <hr></hr>
                                <p>In a world where autonomy is getting ever more prevalent across all industries, it is perhaps most vital within the logistics chain. Globalisation and the rise of e-commerce have resulted in a significant increase in direct home deliveries. According to a 2020 WEF (World Economic Forum) report, e-grocery is growing at a rate of 10% per annum, on par with instant delivery which is also growing at 10% per annum, this trend shows no signs of slowing and is particularly straining on last-mile delivery. We cannot sustain growth at this rate with current last-mile logistics solutions which mainly rely on manpower, which is in decline and unreliable (as seen with recent staff shortages and strikes).</p>
                                <p>Not only do we have a rise in demand for online orders, but customer expectations on delivery speed are going up. 2 hour delivery might have been revolutionary two years ago, but today, consumers expect it as a standard aspect of the customer experience. According to a 2022 research report by Capgemini, this is especially true with younger shoppers who are on average willing to pay 5% of the order total for two-hour delivery versus 2.2% among boomer shoppers. Urban shoppers will increasingly be an interesting market to tap into for players in the last-mile delivery industry, as they are willing to pay on average 3.6% of the basket total on delivery compared to rural shoppers who average 2.6%.</p>
                                <p>The likes of Amazon have recognised this and because of it, they are dominating the market as they deliver to 72% of all customers within 24 hours. In order to compete, another giant, Alibaba, has committed to investing an estimated $15 billion in logistics automation and driverless technology over the next five years.</p>
                                <p>For drone fleet operators, urban delivery presents bigger challenges that need to be overcome, however if done correctly, the possibilities are endless. More automation will result in higher cost savings throughout the drone logistics chain, from preparing cargo up until last-mile delivery. To make this happen, commercial drone fleet operators and flight regulators need to work together. At Kernel Dynamics we've identified 5 processes that need to be automated in order to enable fully autonomous last-mile drone delivery within urban areas.</p>

                                    Preparation of delivery cargo
                                    </h4>
                                
                                <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/drone-delivery-illustration-concept_114360-770.jpg?w=2000" class="img-res" alt="">
                                <p>There have been significant developments in warehouse automation (intralogistics) in recent years, and we believe that soon there will be a new segment to this market which involves integrating drones, preparing customer orders according to said drone specifications and payload loading systems within a warehouse environment.</p>
                                <p>Smaller indoor drones could be used for warehouse inventory and facility inspection. Automated robotics similar to those at Ocado could be used to collect and prepare customer orders and load them onto conveyor belt systems leading up to fleets of drones lined up at an opening of the warehouse. This payload could then be attached to a drone, which has received permission to takeoff to the designated delivery destination.</p>
                                <p>Automating at this scale will require a number of hardware and software developments, but with the power of AI, a system like this can make efficient decisions.</p>

                                <h4>Pre-flight systems tests</h4>
                                <br></br>
                                
                                <img src="https://www.unmannedsystemstechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Alpha-Unmanned-Systems-HALT-helicopter-test-bench.jpg">
                                <p>Current solutions require physical observation and testing of a drone prior to it taking off. This checklist may include a number of different tests, from general body observations to individual component testing. We think that with the power of computer vision, strategically placed cameras can make these observations themselves and arrive at a decision on whether it is safe to fly as long as it meets a certain safety threshold.</p>
                                <p>Prior to flight, a drone could run its motors individually, battery voltages could be monitored and visual inspections could be made to make sure every component is in working order. If not, the system would flag the drone up for maintenance, which will require human intervention.</p>

                                <h4>Tracking and flight path management</h4>
                                <br></br>
                                <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cnu0m8re1exe/1uvH4Z3wYHREy0dKOFKlDw/c1ea4fbfaa325a2841f48c006be8a9e8/Drones.jpg">
                                <p>Infrastructure is currently being built to manage unmanned aircraft systems. One of the key components of this being UTMs (unmanned traffic management) which oversee airspace and manage access for drones. There are a number of private companies working on these systems and although they have private applications, some also work with aviation authorities for the management of UAS on a larger scale. More than 90% of drones operate within stable coverage of mobile networks, which makes UTMs a viable solution to manage drone traffic.</p>
                                <p>Remote ID is another solution that allows government authorities to identify drones in their airspace (similar to an electronic license plate) and it's becoming an FAA requirement. The way this works is the drone broadcasts its Remote ID via radio frequency with direct periodic broadcasts, and this becomes accessible to law enforcement and the general public. The following information must be broadcasted:</p>
   
                                <p>•	UAS operator registration number </br>
                                    •	Drone serial number</br>
                                    •	Geographical position and height above the surface or take-off point</br>
                                    •	True course and ground speed</br>
                                    •	Geographical position of the remote pilot or the take-off point</br>
                                    </p>
                                <hr></hr>
                                <h4>Specialised urban infrastructure</h4>

                                <br></br>
                                <img src="https://futuristspeaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/futurist-speaker-thomas-frey-urban-drone-air-ports-what-to-expect.jpg">
                                <p>One of the most important catalysts for an urban drone delivery ecosystem will be innovations that help with the four processes listed above. For example, city wide drone charging structures could be installed similar to electric car charging points. This would greatly increase use cases for drones as delivery range increases, and as battery technology develops, these charging stops could be less than a few minutes long. This presents another commercial opportunity as operators of these stations could take reservations and charge a fee based on usage.</p>
                                <p>A common feature in urban areas are high rises and apartment buildings. Solutions could be integrated into these buildings to allow consumers to receive drone deliveries in a quick and convenient way. Alternatively, drop-off stations could be constructed at various points within a city, for customer collection.</p>

                                <p>There are many opportunities within this fast-growing sector and it's exciting to think about how the urban drone delivery landscape could look in a few years time.</p>
                                <hr></hr>
                                <h4>We believe autonomous drones and dark stores are the future</h4>
                                <p>Kernel Dynamics is committed to its mission to build fully autonomous drone delivery systems and is ready to work with aviation authorities to make this happen. Our Feynman Dock and Inertia Store system which is similar to a dark store, has the ability to prepare customer orders and load payload fully autonomously.</p>
